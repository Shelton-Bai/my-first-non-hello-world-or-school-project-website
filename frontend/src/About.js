			<p>
				{"\t"}This website is built mostly using React, with other node packages like Express, Axios, and CORS to handle API requests. It's 
				hosted on an Oracle Cloud Instance, run from 3 Docker containers (one for the frontend, one for the API, and one for the SQL 
				database). The SQL database is just there to store comments, and has a single table which stores the commenter, the comment, and
				the timestamp of the comment.

			<h1 className="text-4xl">About Me:</h1>
			<p>
				{"\t"}My name is Shelton Bai, and I'm a 21 year old fresh college graduate with a bachelor's in Computer Science. I've been coding since
				I was in 8th grade, starting with very basic Javascript tutorials on Khan Academy. In high school I decided to expand this curiosity
				by taking some of the computer science classes offered, which lead me to major in it at the University of Pittsburgh.<br/>
				{"\t"}In my free time, I mostly like to read and play video games with friends. I'd even say that I'm quite good at some
				video games, especially competitive Pok√©mon. I've picked up many other hobbies throughout the years, such as Taekwondo, blacksmithing,
				and drawing, but they were mostly fleeting and I stopped for one reason or another. I would like to use this website as an excuse to
				get back into some of them, though.
