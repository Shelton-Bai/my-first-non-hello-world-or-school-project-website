						<p>I managed to snag one of those Ampere A1 instances on the Oracle Cloud Free Tier because I wanted to host a modded Minecraft

						to set up the server, but I'm afraid that if I don't do anything with the instance Oracle is going to
						take it away to free up space for new instances, so just to err on the side of caution, I'll host this website on it.</p>
