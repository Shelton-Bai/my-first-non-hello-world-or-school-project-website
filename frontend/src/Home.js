						Hi! I'm Shelton.

						I'm a software developer from Audubon, Pennsylvania, a suburb near Philly. I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, and I am currently searching for employment. Feel free to check out the Skills and Projects pages for a closer look at some of the things I can do, and if you have any suggestions, please leave a comment by the About page.

					<br/>
					I was feeling kinda left out not having a personal website, because every software developer worth their salt has one. So I grabbed an Oracle Cloud Instance (because their free tier is completely free, not like just a free trial) and bada bing bada boom, here we are. The first iterations of this website were, let's just say not so easy on the eyes, but after watching a few YouTube videos and following their suggestions on designing websites, I'm happy with this current look.
					<br/><br/>
					I also took a look at other people's portfolio websites, and most of them had this all-business air to them, saying stuff following a template like "My name is [Person], I build highly-scalable solutions for digital business" or something. I get why they do it, and I understand that it helps other people quickly generalize their skillset, but it's also not my style. If you want that sort of intro, my resume is on the Skills page, but here, I'd like to show more than just my skillset.
